This is sample code when learning antlr4.
## csv 
Purpose: Load csv file content to a list, which element is a mapping from csv header to value

Structure:
- CSV.g4        -> csv grammar definition file
- t.csv         -> sample csv file to test
- LoadCSV.java  -> main logic file
- other files   -> generated by antlr

Run:

```
$ antlr4 CSV.g4
-> generate the CSV*.java files

$ javac CSV*.java LoadCSV.java
-> compile to *.class file

$ java LoadCSV t.csv
-> Output [{Details=Mid Bonus, Month=June, Amount="$2,000"}, {Details=, Month=January, Amount="""zippo"""}, {Details=Total Bonuses, Month="", Amount="$5,000"}]

```
